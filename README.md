**Description:**

The aim of the project is to develop a streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information form it using easyOCR. The extracted information is displayed in the application's GUI (Streamlit).

**Process:**
1. Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information.

2. Implement the image processing and OCR:Use easyOCR to extract the relevant information from the uploaded business card image use image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.

3. Display the extracted information:Once the information has been extracted, display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI.

4. Implement database integration:Use a database management system like MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded business card image use SQL queries to create tables, insert data, and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI.

**Techstack:**
1. Programming language - Python
2. Database - MySQL
3. Library - easyOCR (Optical Character Recognition)
4. GUI - Streamlit
